@MAJORHEADING [Major Undiscovered Shipwrecks]

@subheading [Background]

There have been seven major shipwrecks in the area which have not yet
been discovered. What little information the Department of Ancient
Wrecks has been able to compile may be inaccurate. Due to the
underfunding of our department, we have been unable to confirm the
physical existence of all of these wrecks, but from what we can tell,
most of the fatual information on them is correct.

@subheading [The Ships]

The S.S. Fubleo -- This ship was originally launched in 1672, a spanish
galleon of new design. It made two journeys to the new world,
transporting a cargo rich in jewels and gold. According to the data, the
ship rests at 300 fathoms.

The USS Eisenstadt -- Named after the notorious pirate Jimbo Eisenstadt,
this sturdy, steel-framed ship foundered in a gale. Its cargo was
primarily arms and munitions, but the captain of the ship, Bill Bose,
was later suspected of smuggling ivory. Nothing was every proven
regarding his pirate tendencies. The ship is resting at 200 fathoms.

The Gloria McCorkle -- Named after the famous ballet dancer of the
1700's, the Gloria McCorkle was a merchant ship which struck a coral
reef sometime around 1807. She was believed to be carrying rare silks
and gold ingots, and is assumed to be resting at 150 fathoms

The Black Flag -- Captain Willie Shortbread, a notorious buccaneer, was
blown clear out of the water when an English gunship caught up with him.
The cargo he was carrying was known to be diverse, but according to
records, the last two ships he plundered were carrying chests filled
with jewels of all descriptions. The Black Flag is assumed to rest in
about 100 fathoms of water.
